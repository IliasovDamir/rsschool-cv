**Briefly About Myself:**

Having started my career as an engineer in a small company without any skills, I became one of the best engineers in this company. Six years ago I became the head of the department.

Now working as an engineer gives me extra free time, which I spend studying Front-end development. I am interested in web development because this profession provides huge opportunities for professional growth and a large community of developers.

I am a good, purposeful team worker and really want to learn and develop new skills. I believe that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me go this way and become an experienced Front end developer
